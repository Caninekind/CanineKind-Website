⚠️ **DEPLOY THESE UPDATED RULES TO FIREBASE CONSOLE NOW!**

These rules include support for the new **Tiered Goals System** with admin access controls.

---

## 📋 Step 1: Deploy These Security Rules

Go to **Firebase Console → Firestore Database → Rules** and replace everything with:

```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {

    // Helper function to check if user is admin
    function isAdmin() {
      return request.auth != null
        && exists(/databases/$(database)/documents/users/$(request.auth.token.email))
        && get(/databases/$(database)/documents/users/$(request.auth.token.email)).data.role == 'admin';
    }

    // Users collection
    match /users/{email} {
      // Allow any authenticated user to read their own document
      allow read: if request.auth != null && request.auth.token.email == email;

      // Allow any authenticated user to create their own document
      allow create: if request.auth != null && request.auth.token.email == email;

      // Allow users to update only specific fields in their own document
      allow update: if request.auth != null
                    && request.auth.token.email == email
                    && request.resource.data.diff(resource.data).affectedKeys().hasOnly(['lastLogin', 'displayName', 'photoURL']);

      // Allow users to update documentsComplete field when signing documents
      allow update: if request.auth != null
                    && request.auth.token.email == email
                    && request.resource.data.diff(resource.data).affectedKeys().hasOnly(['documentsComplete', 'documentsCompletedAt']);

      // Allow admins to read ALL user documents
      allow read: if isAdmin();

      // Allow admins to update ALL user documents
      allow update: if isAdmin();

      // Allow admins to delete ALL user documents
      allow delete: if isAdmin();

      // ========================================
      // SIGNED DOCUMENTS SUBCOLLECTION
      // ========================================
      match /signedDocuments/{documentId} {
        // Allow users to read their own signed documents
        allow read: if request.auth != null && request.auth.token.email == email;

        // Allow users to create their own signed documents
        allow create: if request.auth != null && request.auth.token.email == email;

        // Prevent users from modifying signed documents after creation
        allow update: if false;
        allow delete: if false;

        // Allow admins to read ALL signed documents
        allow read: if isAdmin();
      }

      // ========================================
      // OLD GOALS SYSTEM (LEGACY - Keep for backward compatibility)
      // ========================================
      match /goals/{goalId} {
        // Allow users to read/write their own goals
        allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.token.email == email;

        // Allow admins to read/write ALL goals
        allow read, write: if isAdmin();
      }

      // ========================================
      // GOAL ACCESS SETTINGS (NEW - Admin grants access to levels/goals)
      // ========================================
      match /goalAccess/{document} {
        // Allow users to READ their own access settings
        allow read: if request.auth != null && request.auth.token.email == email;

        // Only ADMINS can WRITE access settings
        allow write: if isAdmin();
      }

      // ========================================
      // SELECTED GOALS (NEW - Client's active goals with tasks)
      // ========================================
      match /selectedGoals/{goalId} {
        // Allow users to read/write their own selected goals
        allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.token.email == email;

        // Allow admins to read/write ALL selected goals
        allow read, write: if isAdmin();
      }

      // ========================================
      // SCHEDULES SUBCOLLECTION
      // ========================================
      match /schedules/{scheduleId} {
        // Allow users to read/write their own schedules
        allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.token.email == email;

        // Allow admins to read/write ALL schedules
        allow read, write: if isAdmin();
      }
    }

    // ========================================
    // SESSIONS COLLECTION (Global - filtered by clientEmail)
    // ========================================
    match /sessions/{sessionId} {
      // Allow users to read their own sessions
      allow read: if request.auth != null
                  && resource.data.clientEmail == request.auth.token.email;

      // Allow admins to read/write ALL sessions
      allow read, write: if isAdmin();
    }
  }
}
```

## 📊 New Collections Explained

### 1. `users/{email}/goalAccess/settings`
**Purpose:** Stores which levels/goals a client has access to
**Who can write:** Admins only
**Who can read:** Client (their own) + Admins (all)

**Example data:**
```json
{
  "levels": [1, 2],
  "individualGoals": ["sit", "down"],
  "updatedAt": "2025-01-16T10:00:00Z",
  "updatedBy": "admin@caninekind.com"
}
```

### 2. `users/{email}/selectedGoals/{goalId}`
**Purpose:** Stores client's active goals with task progress
**Who can write:** Client (their own) + Admins (all)
**Who can read:** Client (their own) + Admins (all)

**Example data:**
```json
{
  "level": 1,
  "title": "Sit",
  "emoji": "🪑",
  "description": "Master the fundamental sit command",
  "tasks": [
    {
      "description": "Dog can sit on command with hand signal",
      "completed": true,
      "completedAt": "2025-01-15T14:30:00Z"
    },
    {
      "description": "Dog can sit for 10 seconds before release",
      "completed": false,
      "completedAt": null
    }
  ],
  "progress": 33,
  "selectedAt": "2025-01-14T10:00:00Z"
}
```

### 3. `users/{email}/schedules/weekly`
**Purpose:** Stores client's weekly training schedule
**Who can write:** Client (their own) + Admins (all)
**Who can read:** Client (their own) + Admins (all)

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Error: "Missing or insufficient permissions"

**Cause:** Security rules not deployed or incorrect
**Solution:**
1. Verify rules are deployed in Firebase Console
2. Check "Last deployed" timestamp
3. Re-deploy if needed
4. Clear browser cache and refresh

### Error: "User not authorized"

**Cause:** User role not set correctly
**Solution:**
1. Go to Firestore Database
2. Navigate to `users/{email}`
3. Verify `role` field is set to 'admin' or 'client'

### Goals won't save

**Cause:** Missing `selectedGoals` rules
**Solution:** Deploy the updated rules above

---

## 🎯 Next Steps

After deploying these rules:

1. **Test Admin Access:**
   - Log in as admin
   - Go to Sessions page
   - Select a client
   - Grant Level 1 access
   - Save settings

2. **Test Client Access:**
   - Log in as client
   - Go to Goals page
   - Click on a Level 1 goal
   - Check off tasks
   - Verify progress updates

3. **Remove Temporary Unlock:**
   - In `portal-goals.html` around line 800
   - Remove the `return true;` line
   - Access will now be controlled by admin

---

## 📝 Important Notes

- These rules use a helper function `isAdmin()` for cleaner code
- All new collections are properly scoped under `users/{email}`
- Admins have full read/write access to all data
- Clients can only access their own data
- Goal access is read-only for clients (only admins can grant)

**Deploy these rules NOW to fix the permissions error!** 🚀
